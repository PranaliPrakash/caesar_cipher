# caesar_cipher
It is a system which allows you to either encode or decode a message.

It asks for 3 inputs- 1) either encode or decode 2) the message to be encoded or decoded 3) shift no for the message
for encoding: "the message would be shifted(forward) by the shift no entered by the user and given as the encoded output"
for decoding: "the message is reverse shifted by the shift no and given as the decoded output"

conclusion: "if the user has the *message* and *shift no* he/she can either encode or decode it "


E.G ; INPUT: encode > hello >5
      OUTPUT: Here's the encoded result: mjqqt
      
      INPUT: decode > mjqqt >5
      OUTPUT:Here's the decoded result: hello
     
**** It only shifts the letters in the message . The numbers/symbols/spaces would be displayed as it is****
